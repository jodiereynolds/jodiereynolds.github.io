<p>Yallingup Woodfired Bread is a wood-fired bakery, located in the Margaret River region in Western Australia's extraordinary South West. They produce hand crafted, traditional wood-fired bread, which is certified biodynamic. Believing that a happy baker makes better bread, hundreds of loaves are churned out each afternoon, made using only a dough mixer and old fashioned man power. This is their story, as told by owner Gotthard Baue.</p>

<p>In the lead up to Margaret River Gourmet Escape 2012, a four-day food and wine festival held in WA's South West from November 22 to 25, Tourism Western Australia uncovered some of the people who call the region home, and who are behind the produce that the region is so well known for.</p>

<p>Thanks to its Mediterranean climate and rich fertile soils, WA's South West has a reputation for producing world-class food and wine. The area is also well known for its pristine beaches, enviable surf breaks, ancient tall timber forests and an abundance of flora and fauna.</p>
